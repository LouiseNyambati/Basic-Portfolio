<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Louise Nyambati. I'm 23 years old. I went to school at University of Maryland University College. My major was cybersecurity. Now with my new found love for coding, I've decided to switch my major to Computer Science. I'm from Maryland so I'm taking a semester off from school to go to Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp.</p>
